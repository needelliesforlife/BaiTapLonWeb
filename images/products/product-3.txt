This is a placeholder to indicate that product images should be saved in this directory.

For product 3 (Turmeric Curcumin), you should save an image here named "product-3.jpg".

Local image paths are more reliable than remote URLs from external sites. Try to save images locally whenever possible.

To use local images, set the image path like this:
product.image = "images/products/product-3.jpg";

Or use the new setProductImage function:
setProductImage(3, "images/products/product-3.jpg");
